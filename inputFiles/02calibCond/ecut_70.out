     one-electron contribution =    -101.57838544 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      78.23315590 Ry
     xc contribution           =     -64.65266197 Ry
     ewald contribution        =    -138.99781517 Ry
     one-center paw contrib.   =    -164.15023692 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  18 iterations
